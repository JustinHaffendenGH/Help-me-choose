# Movies Page Enhancement Suggestions

## Overview
The current `movies.html` page provides a basic movie discovery experience with random selection and basic filters. Below are suggestions to enhance functionality, user experience, and features.

## Status & Recent Work
- Favorites system migrated to a dedicated `favorites.html` page (reads/writes the canonical localStorage key `"favorites"`). The in-page favorites panel was removed, export/import/clear controls were added, duplicate CSS was deduped, and a headless smoke test verifies rendering.
- A small helper `seed-favorites.html` was removed from the repo; changes have been committed to `main`.
- Next recommended actions: add a brief README note about the migration and optionally add an end-to-end test (Playwright/Puppeteer) for browser-level verification.

## UI/UX Improvements
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the layout works seamlessly on mobile devices. Consider using CSS Grid or Flexbox for better adaptability.
- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Add a toggle for dark/light mode to improve user comfort, especially for movie enthusiasts who browse at night.
- **Loading States**: Implement skeleton loaders or spinners when fetching movie data to provide visual feedback.
- **Error Handling**: Add user-friendly error messages for API failures or network issues.

## Feature Enhancements
